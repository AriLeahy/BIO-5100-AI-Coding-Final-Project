I have biomechanical data of sea lions performing 180 degree aquatic turns. This data includes animal x,y coordinates of anatomical points of the sea lion throughout the aquatic turn (in meters) labelled “x_space_m” and “y_space_m”, and the timestamps (in seconds) labelled “timestamp_sec” associated with the anatomical x,y coordinates throughout the video.
Can you please write a functional r code that includes all package downloads and library, and utilizes tidyverse and read.csv to access the data file through “ read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv")” Ideally, this r code will use the timestamps, and extracted x,y coordinates of manually tracked 2D video to calculate  the animal’s turning rate ( in degrees per second), turning radius (in meters) across the entirety of the turn. The output should be 2 values, turning rate (in degrees per second) and turning radius (in meters)
