Based off the previous code, the final value for turning rate seem appropriate now. However, the final value for turning radius is incorrect. When I ran this code it provided a turning radius of approximately 8 meters which is impossible because the pool was not that large. Could this be because the animal performed a 180 degree turn and thus performed a turn in more of a "U" shape? Can you edit the code to find a more accurate turning radius?
