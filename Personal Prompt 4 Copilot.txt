I have biomechanical data of sea lions performing aquatic turns. This data includes animal x,y coordinates of anatomical points of the sea lion throughout the aquatic turn (in meters) “x_space_m” and “y_space_m”, and the timestamps (in seconds) “timestamp_sec” associated with the anatomical x,y coordinates throughout the video.

Can you please write a functional r code that includes all package downloads and library, and utilizes tidyverse and read.csv to access the data file through “ read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv")” Ideally, this r code will use the timestamps, and extracted x,y coordinates of manually tracked 2D video to calculate turning parameters such as the animal’s turning rate ( in degrees per second), turning radius (in meters), convert turning rate into radians to then calculate turning velocity ( in meters per second), centripetal acceleration of the turn (in meters per second squared), and g-force of the turn (in multiples of gravitational force), in that specific order. The ideal output will be a table with a single value calculated across the entirety of the turn  for each of the turning parameters (turning rate, turning radius, turning velocity, centripetal acceleration, and g-force).
