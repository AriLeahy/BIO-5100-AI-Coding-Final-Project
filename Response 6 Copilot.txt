Certainly! Let’s break down the task into steps and write an R script that accomplishes what you’ve described. We’ll use the tidyverse package for data manipulation and read.csv to read the data file. Here’s how you can approach this:

    Load Required Packages: First, we’ll load the necessary packages. Make sure you have the tidyverse package installed. If not, you can install it using install.packages("tidyverse"). Then load the package using library(tidyverse).

    Read the Data File: Assuming your data file is named “AI_coding_sea_lion_data.csv” and is located at the specified path, you can read it using read.csv. Adjust the file path accordingly if needed.

    Calculate Turning Rate and Turning Radius: We’ll calculate the turning rate and turning radius based on the x and y coordinates. The turning rate can be computed as the change in angle over time, and the turning radius can be derived from the curvature of the trajectory.

    Output the Results: Finally, we’ll print the calculated turning rate and turning radius.

Here’s an example R script that accomplishes this:

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data file
data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv")

# Calculate turning rate (degrees per second)
# Assuming timestamps are in seconds and x_space_m and y_space_m are columns in the data
delta_x <- diff(data$x_space_m)
delta_y <- diff(data$y_space_m)
delta_time <- diff(data$timestamp_sec)
angles <- atan2(delta_y, delta_x) * 180 / pi
turning_rate <- angles / delta_time

# Calculate turning radius (in meters)
# Assuming x_space_m and y_space_m represent the sea lion's position
radius <- sqrt((data$x_space_m - mean(data$x_space_m))^2 + (data$y_space_m - mean(data$y_space_m))^2)

# Print the results
cat("Turning Rate (degrees per second):", mean(turning_rate), "\n")
cat("Turning Radius (meters):", mean(radius), "\n")


Remember to adjust the column names and file path according to your actual data file. This script assumes that the data is in the correct format with appropriate column names. If there are additional considerations (such as handling missing data or smoothing the trajectory), you can incorporate those as needed. 🌊🦁123
