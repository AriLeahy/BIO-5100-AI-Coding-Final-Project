I have biomechanical data of sea lions performing aquatic turns. This data includes animal body length (in meters) “length_m”, x,y coordinates of anatomical points of the sea lion throughout the aquatic turn (in meters) “x_space_m” and “y_space_m”, and the timestamps (in seconds) “timestamp_sec” associated with the anatomical x,y coordinates throughout the video. 

timestamp_sec	x_space_m	y_space_m	length_m

0.033334	0.623	0.655

Can you please write a functional r code, including all package downloads and library, that will use the animal’s body length, timestamps, and extracted x,y coordinates of manually tracked 2D video to calculate the animal’s turning rate ( in degrees per second), turning radius (in meters), convert turning rate into radians to then calculate turning velocity ( in meters per second), centripetal acceleration of the turn (in meters per second squared), and g-force of the turn (in multiples of gravitational force), in that specific order.
