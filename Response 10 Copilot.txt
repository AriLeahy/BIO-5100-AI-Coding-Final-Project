Absolutely, if the sea lion is performing a “U” shaped turn, then the curvature and hence the turning radius will vary throughout the turn. In this case, it might be more appropriate to calculate the turning radius based on the total distance traveled and the total change in angle.

Here’s how you can modify the R script to calculate these:

# Load necessary libraries
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv")

# Calculate the differences in x, y coordinates and time
data <- data %>%
  mutate(dx = lead(x_space_m) - x_space_m,
         dy = lead(y_space_m) - y_space_m,
         dt = lead(timestamp_sec) - timestamp_sec)

# Calculate the total distance traveled and the total change in angle
total_distance <- sum(sqrt(data$dx^2 + data$dy^2), na.rm = TRUE)
total_angle_change <- 180  # The sea lion performed a 180 degree turn

# Calculate the turning radius based on the total distance and angle change
turning_radius <- total_distance / (total_angle_change * pi / 180)

# Calculate the average turning rate
avg_turning_rate <- total_angle_change / max(data$timestamp_sec, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print the results
print(paste("Average turning rate (in degrees per second): ", avg_turning_rate))
print(paste("Turning radius (in meters): ", turning_radius))

This script calculates the turning radius based on the total distance traveled and the total change in angle, which should give a more accurate estimate for a “U” shaped turn. Please note that this calculation assumes the sea lion is moving at a constant speed, which might not be the case in reality. You might need to adjust the calculations based on the actual movement pattern of the sea lion. Also, please make sure the path to your CSV file is correct. If there are any issues, feel free to ask!
