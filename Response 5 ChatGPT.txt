Sure! Let's go through the code step by step:

    Install and load necessary packages:
        install.packages("tidyverse"): This line installs the tidyverse package if it's not already installed.
        library(tidyverse): This line loads the tidyverse package, which is a collection of R packages designed for data science, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and others.

    Load the data:
        sea_lion_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv"): This line reads the sea lion data from the specified Excel file using the read.csv function. The \\ is used to escape the backslashes in the file path.

    Define a function to calculate turning parameters:
        calculate_turning_parameters: This is a custom function that takes three arguments: x, y, and timestamp, representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and timestamps of the sea lion's movement data, respectively.
        Inside the function:
            dx <- diff(x), dy <- diff(y), dt <- diff(timestamp): These lines calculate the differences between consecutive x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and timestamps, respectively.
            d_theta <- atan2(dy, dx): This calculates the angle turned (in radians) between consecutive points using the atan2 function, which takes the change in y and x coordinates as arguments.
            turning_rate, turning_radius, turning_velocity, centripetal_acceleration, g_force: These variables calculate the turning rate, turning radius, turning velocity, centripetal acceleration, and g-force, respectively, using the formulas provided in the comments.
            The mean function is used to calculate the mean value of each parameter across the entire turn.

    Apply the function to the sea lion data:
        turning_parameters <- calculate_turning_parameters(sea_lion_data$x_space_m, sea_lion_data$y_space_m, sea_lion_data$timestamp_sec): This line applies the calculate_turning_parameters function to the sea lion data, passing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and timestamps as arguments. It stores the calculated turning parameters in the turning_parameters data frame.

    Print the calculated turning parameters:
        print(turning_parameters): This line prints out the calculated turning parameters, which include the mean turning rate, turning radius, turning velocity, centripetal acceleration, and g-force across the entire turn.
