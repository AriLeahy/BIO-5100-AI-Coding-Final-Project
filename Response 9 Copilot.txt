Absolutely, if the sea lion is not turning in a perfect circle, we can calculate the instantaneous turning radius and turning rate at each point using the concept of curvature in differential geometry. The curvature of a 2D curve is defined as:

κ=∣x′y′′−y′x′′∣(x′2+y′2)3/2
κ=(x′2+y′2)3/2∣x′y′′−y′x′′∣​

where (x’) and (y’) are the first derivatives (velocities), and (x’‘) and (y’') are the second derivatives (accelerations). The turning radius (R) is then the reciprocal of the curvature, and the turning rate (\omega) (in degrees per second) is the product of the speed (v) and the curvature (\kappa).

Here’s how you can modify the R script to calculate these:

# Load necessary libraries
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\ariel\\OneDrive\\BAYLOR\\BIO 5100 AI Coding\\AI coding sea lion data.csv")

# Calculate the differences in x, y coordinates and time
data <- data %>%
  mutate(dx = lead(x_space_m) - x_space_m,
         dy = lead(y_space_m) - y_space_m,
         dt = lead(timestamp_sec) - timestamp_sec)

# Calculate the velocities and accelerations
data <- data %>%
  mutate(vx = dx / dt,
         vy = dy / dt,
         ax = lead(vx) / dt,
         ay = lead(vy) / dt)

# Calculate the curvature, turning radius and turning rate
data <- data %>%
  mutate(curvature = abs(vx * ay - vy * ax) / (vx^2 + vy^2)^(3/2),
         radius = 1 / curvature,
         turning_rate = sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2) * curvature * 180 / pi)

# Calculate the average turning rate and turning radius
avg_turning_rate <- mean(data$turning_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
avg_turning_radius <- mean(data$radius, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print the results
print(paste("Average turning rate (in degrees per second): ", avg_turning_rate))
print(paste("Average turning radius (in meters): ", avg_turning_radius))


This script calculates the turning rate and turning radius at each point based on the velocities and accelerations in the x,y coordinates. It then calculates the average turning rate and turning radius over the entire turn. Please note that this calculation is more nuanced and takes into account the actual movement pattern of the sea lion. Also, please make sure the path to your CSV file is correct. If there are any issues, feel free to ask!
